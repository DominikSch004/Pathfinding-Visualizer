# Pathfinding Visualizer

## A Pathfinding Visualizer, which allows the user to create a custom Maze and visualize different Algorithms to solve the Maze and find the End Node. 

## Features

- 5 different Pathfinding Algorithms to choose from:
    - A* Search
    - Dijkstras Algorithm
    - Greedy Best First Search
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
- Easy to use PyGame Menu and UI
- Ability to reconstruct the shortest Path after visualization
- Real time visualization to understand different Concepts of the Algorithms
- Ability to pause/resume the Algorithm

## Extra Information

Note that Pygame's graphics might deviate, depending on the System you are using.
There should be no Problems on a Windows machine, whereas on a Mac the text might look blurry or pixelated.
